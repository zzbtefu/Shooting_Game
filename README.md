This is my first game, which is not perfect and still remains some points that need some optimazations.
For example, when you shoot bullets multiple times, the game will be getting heavier and heavier.
In my opinion, the reason should be that those bullets continue to be recorded.
When those records are too much, the processing will be hard for computer.
But After clearing the stage, the process is refreshed and the game becomes normal.
Therfore, the refreshing process works only after clearing the stages, not bullets vanishing.
